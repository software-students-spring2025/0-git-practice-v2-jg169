## Why I liked this article

I liked this article because it discusses the future of software engineering which there is a lot of uncertainty in right now (particularly at the level with automation). There are many forums such as subreddits discussing computer science careers that are trying to speculate what areas might be opportunities in the **future**. At the moment, it seems that a lot of ideas seem to be based on the past predicting the future, which of course is a decent and empirical method of prediction but things are changing. The article provides an argument based off of how new technologies can be implemented and a description of what that could be like. 

Otherwise, I believe that the article is also my introduction to the concept of platform engineering although I am not aware of how common it is. This is a term that I will perhaps note of in the future. 

## Additional Perspective (by Polaris)

I also found this article interesting due to its discussion of platform engineering's role in software development. It's fascinating to see how platform engineering could streamline development processes and automate infrastructure management. The article's insights about future trends in software engineering, particularly regarding automation and platform tools, provide valuable perspective on where our industry is heading.
